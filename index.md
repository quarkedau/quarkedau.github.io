# Our mission

At Quark Education, we are committed to reinforcing, augmenting, and reframing the education students receive. Our aim is to contextualise the school experience, encourage students to extend their capability and develop greater initiative.

We seek to motivate, inspire, and empower young people to live their best lives.

# Our values

Honesty, authenticity, quirkiness, hustle, appreciation, inspiration.


# Why you should have us

We are both still young, but have been fortunate enough to receive many opportunities to extend ourselves.

We occupy a very unique position. We're still fresh out of school, and can honestly and openly engage with students from the perspective of peers. But we're also old enough, and made enough mistakes, to provide a little wisdom.

We are also passionate about integrating with the existing Victorian Curriculum.

# Who we are

Tyler is deeply passionate about rural Victoria, having a lot of involvement with Youthrive Victoria (formerly MSRF). He is currently studying a Masters of (Primary) Teaching, having stitched up his Bachelor of Media and Communications in 2018.

Gabe is currently studying Chemistry and Philosophy. He prides himself on building a wide array of skills and drawing on many places for a deeper understanding of the world around him.

We met 7 years ago at the School for Student Leadership. Our experience there opened our eyes to a world of education beyond textbooks and exams. We have been passionate about education ever since.

# What we've done

For the past 2 years we have been running classes at the School for Student Leadership. These have discussed self-awareness, mental health, and applying lessons of leadership to real world situations.

We have also run a day-long leadership intensive at Irymple Secodary College, working with the Student Leadership Council.
